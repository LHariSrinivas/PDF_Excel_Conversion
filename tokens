Some improvements that need to be made: 
    1. Since 2025 is coming to a close, we need to now load 2026. So the year variable also
    becomes a dictionary or a list to store the years
    2. Instead of always trying to look at whether the file exists for a particular month every day,
    we can do the following:
        Check for 2-3 sites. If there are no files present, then there is no point in checking for 
        the other sites, since there won't be any files. By doing this our process becomes faster.
        If files are present, then work as usual i.e., Download PDF -> Convert to Excel -> 
        Merge Excel
    3. set up env variables so that on github no one will be able to see the local folder names
